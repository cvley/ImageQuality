# ImageQuality

generally translation from Matlab to Python and Golang.

Matlab code can be download from [here](http://live.ece.utexas.edu/research/quality/).

To run Python code, you should install `pywt` library first, with `pip`:

```
pip install pywt
```

`pywt` implemented the wavelet transform used in the algorithm.

And you should install `svm` toolkit based on your system.

Golang version is under development.
